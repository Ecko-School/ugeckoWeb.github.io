For the images and image with a link:
Seperate rectangle area (in the middle between the hobby area and the favorite websites)
Have a paragraph about my music interests, maybe games interest aswell (note: its already covered in the hobby area so switch it up to relate with the images more)
Have images of games I play, aswell as some music covers from ken carson or something.
And ofc something that leads the visitor to the images, like: "Here are some images of my favorite games and albums by artists I love"


Requirements still to be met:
Minimum of 6 images (2 of those must be positioned side by side)
Image thats linked to a websites
Should include one list format (The programming languages I know how to write hello world in probably)


Requirements that are met:
Digital Picture
Detailed text about me and the topic (Will be modified)
Sentence with a different color for each word
Favorite links portion
Website has a background 
Background Music


Additions that I added:
Clock cursor effect
Many CSS animations (Rectangles, text)


Other ideas to possibly implement if completed before due date:
Add custom bar that is stuck to the bottom of the screen for music controls (Play, Pause, Volume slider, Track Progress)
