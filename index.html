        <div class ="headingTextFormat"><h1 style="justify-content:center; display: flex;">My Hobby</h1></div>
        <div class="textFormat"><div class="textRainbow">My top hobby would be computers or gaming.</div> For most of the day im in my room gaming and socializing with friends, or developing something.
            Ive been interested in computers, or really anything that contains a circuit board ever since I was young, I found it very fascinating
            and amazing that something like that was possible or thought of. To this day I still have a strong interest in computers and electrical devices
            and I believe I will create my future very heavily around it.
            <p> 
            As of gaming, I really enjoy FPS or First Person Shooter type games. Ive always enjoyed shooter games like CallOfDuty (Especially zombies),
            aswell as games that take it to another level, such as The Finals or Splitgate. I do have a heavy interest on FPS games, however I do 
            enjoy other game genres such as; Horror like Phasmophobia, VR like Beatsaber, and Sandboxes like Minecraft. 
            <p>
            What made this possible is my computer, but before all of this I only started off with a gameboy playing Sims, then I got my first xbox.
            After that I have increasingly got more and more interested in gaming. I kept upgrading my gaming setup, and then I eventually wanted 
            to build myself a computer in 2020. Over the 3 years ive had it has given me a path to technology I never have thought I would have taken.
            Ive learned to build discord bots, create windows applications, make games in game engines like Unity and UnrealEngine, learn programming languages, and more. </div>
